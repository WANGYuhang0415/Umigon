                                <p>As a condition to using Explore Your Data's application programming interface or other data supplied by Explore Your Data ("API"), you must comply with the following API Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms without limitations or exclusions, Explore Your Data does not grant you a license to use the API.
                                  The following are terms of a legal agreement (the "Agreement") between you, individually and/or as an agent on behalf of an entity or another registered user ("you"), and Explore Your Data Funding LLC ("Explore Your Data", "we", or "us") that sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of Explore Your Data's API (the "API Terms of Use"). The API is owned and operated by Explore Your Data. The API, together with all tools, data, text, articles, design, source code, software, photos, images and other content or information (including without limitation all information included on the Data Export page located at DataExport) made available through the API is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "API Service." By accessing, browsing or using the API Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement between you and Explore Your Data and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also agree to comply with Explore Your Data's API Terms of Use, as they may be amended from time to time.
                                  We reserve the right to amend the API Terms of Use at any time and posting the revised API Terms of Use on the Explore Your Data website (the "Site") shall be notice to you of such changes. You should check the API Terms of Use periodically for changes. Unless otherwise indicated, all changes shall be effective upon posting and will supersede all previous versions. Your continued use of the API Service after any change to the API Terms of Use constitutes your agreement to be bound by all provisions of the most current API Terms of Use as posted on the Site. If you disagree with the API Terms of Use or any changes to the API Terms of Use, your only option is to discontinue your use of the API Service. We may, in our sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else.

                                As a condition to using Explore Your Data's application programming interface or other data supplied by Explore Your Data ("API"), you must comply with the following API Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms without limitations or exclusions, Explore Your Data does not grant you a license to use the API.<br/>
                                The following are terms of a legal agreement (the "Agreement") between you, individually and/or as an agent on behalf of an entity or another registered user ("you"), and Explore Your Data Funding LLC ("Explore Your Data", "we", or "us") that sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of Explore Your Data's API (the "API Terms of Use"). The API is owned and operated by Explore Your Data. The API, together with all tools, data, text, articles, design, source code, software, photos, images and other content or information (including without limitation all information included on the Data Export page located at DataExport) made available through the API is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "API Service." By accessing, browsing or using the API Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement between you and Explore Your Data and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also agree to comply with Explore Your Data's API Terms of Use, as they may be amended from time to time.<br/>
                                We reserve the right to amend the API Terms of Use at any time and posting the revised API Terms of Use on the Explore Your Data website (the "Site") shall be notice to you of such changes. You should check the API Terms of Use periodically for changes. Unless otherwise indicated, all changes shall be effective upon posting and will supersede all previous versions. Your continued use of the API Service after any change to the API Terms of Use constitutes your agreement to be bound by all provisions of the most current API Terms of Use as posted on the Site. If you disagree with the API Terms of Use or any changes to the API Terms of Use, your only option is to discontinue your use of the API Service.  We may, in our sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else.<br/>
                        <br/>
                                LICENSE TO USE API SERVICE<br/>

The license shall continue for as long as we make the API Service available to you; provided, however, that the license will terminate immediately if you violate any terms of this Agreement. We may, in our sole discretion, with or without cause, modify, enhance, suspend, terminate or discontinue this license, or restrict your access to all or any part of the API Service at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else. The API Service may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors, and Explore Your Data does not undertake any obligation or responsibility to update or amend the API Service, or to provide support for your use of the API Service.
